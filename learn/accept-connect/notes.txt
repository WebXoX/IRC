accept the socket - accept()
int accept(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t *addrlen);
headers
#include <sys/socket.h>

for more info :-> https://manual.cs50.io/2/accept

The accept() system call is used with connection-based socket types (SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_SEQPACKET).
It extracts the first connection request on the queue of pending connections for the listening socket,
sockfd, creates a new connected socket, and returns a new file descriptor referring to that socket.
The newly created socket is not in the listening state. The original socket sockfd is unaffected by this call.

The argument sockfd is a socket that has been created with socket(2), bound to a local address with 
bind(2), and is listening for connections after a listen(2).

The argument addr is a pointer to a sockaddr structure. This structure is 
filled in with the address of the peer socket, as known to the communications 
layer. The exact format of the address returned addr is determined by the 
socket's address family (see socket(2) and the respective protocol man pages).
When addr is NULL, nothing is filled in; in this case, addrlen is not 
used, and should also be NULL.

The addrlen argument is a value-result argument: the caller must initialize 
it to contain the size (in bytes) of the structure pointed to by addr; 
on return it will contain the actual size of the peer address.

The returned address is truncated if the buffer provided is too small;
in this case, addrlen will return a value greater 
than was supplied to the call.


connect the socket - connect()

int connect(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen);
headers
#include <sys/socket.h>

for more info :-> https://manual.cs50.io/2/connect

The connect() system call connects the socket referred to 
by the file descriptor sockfd to the address specified by 
addr. The addrlen argument specifies the size of addr. 
The format of the address in addr is determined by the 
address space of the socket sockfd; see socket(2) for 
further details.

If the socket sockfd is of type SOCK_DGRAM, then addr 
is the address to which datagrams are sent by default, 
and the only address from which datagrams are received. 
If the socket is of type SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_SEQPACKET, 
this call attempts to make a connection to the socket that 
is bound to the address specified by addr.
