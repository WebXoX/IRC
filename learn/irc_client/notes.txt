when a socket is created it exists in a name space 
but it has no address assigned to it. 
bind()assigns the address specified by addr to the 
socket referred to by the file descriptor sockfd. 
addrlen specifies the size, in bytes, of the
address structure pointed to by addr. 
Traditionally, this operation is 
called “assigning a name to a socket”.
