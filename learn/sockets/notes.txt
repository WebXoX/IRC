It acts like a pipe between computers on a network

two way communication (can send and receive data)

2 types of sockets
	Streaming socket:a TCP connection and it constantly 
					 checks if the connect is live
	
	Datagram socket: a UDP connection doesnt check if connection is established 
					 and just sends the data, less secure

server:: port number can be set
client:: port number is random

when client connects to server
server:: creates a new socket and the client uses the new one

server functions

1. initialize wsa - wsaStartup(). --windows
2. Create a socket - socket()
3. bind the socket -listen()
4. Accept a connection - accept(),connect().
5. Send and receive data - recv().
6. send(),recvfrom(),sendto().
7. Disconnect - closesocket().

client functions

1. initialize wsa - wsaStartup(). --windows
2. Create a socket - socket()
4. Connect to the server - connect().
5. Send and receive data - recv(),send(),recvfrom,sendto().
7. Disconnect - closesocket().
